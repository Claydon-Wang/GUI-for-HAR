## HAR: GUI for WISDM

This project is a GUI based on Tkinter. The sensor datas operated by sliding window are stored in "/dataset/WISDM". The data can be download from <a href="https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php">WISDM</a> website. We can extract random samples from them to predict human actions.
